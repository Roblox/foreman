unable to parse Foreman configuration file (at {{CWD}}foreman.toml): missing field `tools`

A Foreman configuration file looks like this:

[tools] # list the tools you want to install under this header

# each tool is on its own line, the tool name is on the left
# side of `=` and the right side tells Foreman where to find
# it and which version to download
tool_name = { github = "user/repository-name", version = "1.0.0" }

# tools hosted on gitlab follows the same structure, except
# `github` is replaced with `gitlab`

# Examples:
stylua = { github = "JohnnyMorganz/StyLua", version = "0.11.3" }
darklua = { gitlab = "seaofvoices/darklua", version = "0.7.0" }
