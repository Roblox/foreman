unable to parse Foreman authentication file (at {{FOREMAN_HOME}}auth.toml): expected an equals, found eof at line 1 column 8

A Foreman authentication file looks like this:

# For authenticating with GitHub.com, put a personal access token here under the
# `github` key. This is useful if you hit GitHub API rate limits or if you need
# to access private tools.

github = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# For authenticating with GitLab.com, put a personal access token here under the
# `gitlab` key. This is useful if you hit GitLab API rate limits or if you need
# to access private tools.

gitlab = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
